#### `PropertyEditor` 

---

spring 中属性编辑器的例子：

* 在xml中为对应属性赋予值，spring通过 `ClassEditor` 去处理 `String` 使之对应到 `Class`对象上
* Spring MVC 中的请求属性 通过` PropertyEditor` 对应到 `Controller` 上

| Class                     | Explanation                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ByteArrayPropertyEditor` | Editor for byte arrays. Converts strings to their corresponding byte representations. Registered by default by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `ClassEditor`             | Parses Strings that represent classes to actual classes and vice-versa. When a class is not found, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `CustomBooleanEditor`     | Customizable property editor for `Boolean` properties. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl` but can be overridden by registering a custom instance of it as a custom editor. |
| `CustomCollectionEditor`  | Property editor for collections, converting any source `Collection` to a given target `Collection` type. |
| `CustomDateEditor`        | Customizable property editor for `java.util.Date`, supporting a custom `DateFormat`. NOT registered by default. Must be user-registered with the appropriate format as needed. |
| `CustomNumberEditor`      | Customizable property editor for any `Number` subclass, such as `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, or `Double`. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl` but can be overridden by registering a custom instance of it as a custom editor. |
| `FileEditor`              | Resolves strings to `java.io.File` objects. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `InputStreamEditor`       | One-way property editor that can take a string and produce (through an intermediate `ResourceEditor` and `Resource`) an `InputStream` so that `InputStream` properties may be directly set as strings. Note that the default usage does not close the `InputStream` for you. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `LocaleEditor`            | Can resolve strings to `Locale` objects and vice-versa (the string format is `*[country]*[variant]`, same as the `toString()` method of `Locale`). By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `PatternEditor`           | Can resolve strings to `java.util.regex.Pattern` objects and vice-versa. |
| `PropertiesEditor`        | Can convert strings (formatted with the format defined in the javadoc of the `java.util.Properties` class) to `Properties` objects. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
| `StringTrimmerEditor`     | Property editor that trims strings. Optionally allows transforming an empty string into a `null` value. NOT registered by default — must be user-registered. |
| `URLEditor`               | Can resolve a string representation of a URL to an actual `URL` object. By default, registered by `BeanWrapperImpl`. |
